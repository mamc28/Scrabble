(Scrabble (like the board game))

(Max and Maya)

Our project is essentially the board game Scrabble. Just like in real life, players, in our case two of them, take turns forming words on a 15x15 gameboard using letter tiles with assigned point values. The players enter their names and the game then begins. Players are given a set of 7 tiles. When is is their turn, they have to option to either skip their turn, refresh all 7 of their tiles, place a real word down, or quit the game, in the case that they would both see their scores and no other moves would be made. If they choose to enter a word, they are then asked if they would like to place it vertically or horizontally, a 1 singnaling a vertical word and a 2 indicating a horizontal word. Next, they must indicate the coordinates of where they want to start their word - inputting a number between 0 and 14 for both the starting row and column. The player must also specify which specific tiles they will be using from their pieces that are not already on the board so that they can have those removed from their set of tiles and receive new ones. After all this information has been filled in by the user, by using magic, the Scrabble board checks to make sure the word is valid by cross-referencing it with a dictionary, and making sure it does not form other invalid words, and also ensuring that the word fits on the board. If all these conditions are met, then the spaces are filled with the user's word, based on where they specified they wanted to place it! The score of their word is then calculated. They can then see their score, and their turn is up. As long as the tile bag is not empty, the next player does the same. The game ends when the tile bag is empty and no more words can be formed.
